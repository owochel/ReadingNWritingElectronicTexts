# ReadingNWritingElectronicTexts


This repositories collects all my creation I made the class - reading and writing electronic text - Spring2022 with Allison Parrish.

[Assignment 1:](docs/some-poetry-generators.ipynb)
Try some poem generators.
I made some changes to the Dadaist poem generator and love letter generator.
For the Dadaist poem generator, I changed the original text to a recent curatorial release I wrote and did some string cleaning to exclude the symbols in the text. The original instruction by Tristian Tzara did not clarify the cases in symbols in the text. With the original poem generators, the symbols are assumed as words and mixed in the sentences.  
For the love letter generator, I manipulated the code into a cover letter generator. It is more limiting and has less variation than the love letter generator that was provided because the formats of a love letter could be more loose and creative than a cover letter. However, the manipulation has a similar concept by making a generator for something that ought to be genuine and expressions of the truth. The cover letter generator is communicating the tiresome in applying to positions at multifarious institutes/companies when the original cover letters are supposed to be frank and passionate.
