# ReadingNWritingElectronicTexts


This repositories collects all my creation I made the class - reading and writing electronic text - Spring2022 with Allison Parrish.

[Assignment 1:](/some-poetry-generators.ipynb)
Try some poem generators.
I made some changes to the Dadaist poem generator and love letter generator.
For the Dadaist poem generator, I changed the original text to a recent curatorial release I wrote and did some string cleaning to exclude the symbols in the text. The original instruction by Tristian Tzara did not clarify the cases in symbols in the text. With the original poem generators, the symbols are assumed as words and mixed in the sentences.  
For the love letter generator, I manipulated the code into a cover letter generator. It is more limiting and has less variation than the love letter generator that was provided because the formats of a love letter could be more loose and creative than a cover letter. However, the manipulation has a similar concept by making a generator for something that ought to be genuine and expressions of the truth. The cover letter generator is communicating the tiresome in applying to positions at multifarious institutes/companies when the original cover letters are supposed to be frank and passionate. 



[Assignment 2:](/pythonPoem.ipynb)
I hope to dig into the idea of data structure and manipulation in this poem. The original input text is a simple line of text - "This is a python poem". By manipulating its order of appending and releasing, the final poem presents a deterministic result of a triadic/stepped line poem. In thinking of stacks and queues for data structure, the FIFO and LIFO order or the two data structures made this poem. For future development, I hope to manipulate the order of the text even further. It took me a lot of time trying to get the poem tidily organized for the first trail. The effort also grants me a stronger understanding of the code, and therefore, I will be able to do more modification in the future.

[Assignment 3:](/Ingredients.ipynb)
I struggled with relationships with food for a long time in undergraduate and even still a bit at this moment. There was a period when I had to actively look at what and how others are eating to elect my food and pace myself because what seemed so natural to others regarding eating were not simply not registering in my mind. I was able to calculate calories of a plate-full of food in seconds at glance. I stared at the nutrition facts of packages for hours in guilts and remorse. And the worst part is that I am a really foodie person by nature - I love to cook and learn new recipe, try new flavors and experience novel food, and greatly enjoy eating in general. Therefore, my troubled food relationship took a major part of joy out of my life.

Making this generator, I was able to do the design and calculation without additional research and reference because the layout and "suggested" values were sealed into my brain (I still searched to varified and no correction was needed). It is because how the piece originated from such intamate personal experience, instead of treating the final result as piece of work, I hope to emphasize the creation process for this piece. As a result, I used print() instead of a saved value or tracery for this creation. The generated nutrition fact table is directly printed out on the output window and supposedly left no marks after next run like how I hope I could view a nutrition fact table when I was troubled by my relationship with food.
