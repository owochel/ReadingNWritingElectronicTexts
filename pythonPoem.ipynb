    "The original input text is a simple line of text - \"This is a python poem\".\n",
    "By manipulating its order of appending and releasing,\n",
    "the final poem presents a deterministic result of a triadic/stepped line poem.\n",
    "In thinking of stacks and queues for data structure, \n",
    "the FIFO and LIFO order or the two data structures made this poem.\n",
    "For future development, I hope to manipulate the order of the text even further.\n",

    "I will be able to do more modification in the future."
